# Flex-fuel design

Status: design proposal. Every ECU-side insertion point below is an RE
target (section 7) and must reach VERIFIED-DYNAMIC before the corresponding
patch is written.

## 1. Architecture

```
GM/Continental flex-fuel sensor ──50-150 Hz / 1-5 ms──▶ Pico 2 (capture, plausibility)
        │                                                  │ CAN 500 kbit/s, 10 Hz
   in the fuel FEED line                                   ▼
                                              powertrain CAN (behind the J533 gateway)
                                                           │
                                              MED9.1.1: spare RX slot ─▶ ff_rx (validate, filter)
                                                           │
                          ┌──────────────┬─────────────────┼──────────────┬──────────────┐
                          ▼              ▼                 ▼              ▼              ▼
                    fuel factor    ignition blend    start/afterstart  rail-pressure   diagnostics
                    (mass -> te)   (KFZW offset)      enrichment       setpoint raise  (measuring block)
```

MED9.1 has no native flex-fuel function (unlike Simos18 or MED17.1.1), so
all of this is custom code. The proven insertion patterns on Bosch ECUs are:
scale the fuel-mass-to-time constant (woj's ME7.9.10 `rkte` hook), blend
double maps the way the ECU already blends `KFZW/KFZW2` (prj), and drive an
existing variant selector (`vkKraQu`, if present in our software).

## 2. Sensor and Pico

Sensor: GM/Continental 13577379 (3/8" barbs) or 13577394; open-collector
square wave, needs a 2.2-3.5 kOhm pull-up to 5 V (1 k/10 k do not work),
12 V supply, sensor ground. Frequency 50 Hz = 0 % .. 150 Hz = 100 % ethanol
(linear); low-pulse width 1 ms = -40 C .. 5 ms = 125 C fuel temperature
(`T = 41.5 * ms - 81.25`). Fault codes: 180-190 Hz contaminated fuel or
internal fault, below 50 Hz or no signal = fault. Pump "E85" typically reads
~75-81 %. Mount in the **feed** line; return-line mounting traps air and
produces spurious readings (multiple reports).

Pico firmware requirements (replaces the current pot demo in `pico_can_sender/`):

- Edge-timestamp capture on the sensor input (both edges), 4-sample ring
  average of period and low time, 250 ms update, debounce 0.25 ms.
- Plausibility: frequency window 45-155 Hz valid; 155-200 Hz "contaminated";
  outside or no edges for 500 ms "fault". Rate limit of the reported E% is
  not done on the Pico (the ECU does it) but the raw and the averaged value
  are both sent.
- Frame (Zeitronix ECA-2 CAN compatible), default id **0x0EC**, DLC 8, 10 Hz:

| Byte | Content |
|---|---|
| 0 | ethanol % (0-100), averaged |
| 1 | fuel temperature C + 40 |
| 2 | raw frequency / 2 (Hz) |
| 3 | rolling counter (0-255) |
| 4-5 | reserved 0 |
| 6 | firmware version |
| 7 | status: 0 OK, 1 sensor fault, 2 contaminated fuel, 3 not ready |

Bytes 0, 1 and 7 match the Zeitronix layout so an ECA-2 CAN can be dropped
in; bytes 2-6 are ours. The id must be confirmed free on **our** powertrain
CAN with `pi_can_setup/find_active_ids.py` (0x0EC is not in the ECU's RX or
TX tables; the ICAN DBC in `data/` is a different bus). The frame is
injected on the powertrain CAN directly (the gateway does not forward
unknown ids from the OBD port).

Bench: a signal generator (or a second Pico) drives the sensor input 40-200 Hz
to test every status path before the real sensor is wired.

## 3. ECU side

### 3.1 Reception
The CAN receive table at 0x2BC90 has four unused slots (id 0x7FF). Plan:
re-use one slot for 0x0EC, find where its 8 data bytes land in RAM and where
the "new data" flag is set (Phase 1 target), and read them from `ff_rx`,
which runs from a periodic task (100 ms is enough). Alternative if the
slot mechanism is awkward: hook the generic RX dispatcher and intercept id
0x0EC before it is dropped.

#### Added 2026-09-15 (brief B2, issue #12) — slot mechanism resolved, VERIFIED-STATIC

Full derivation and evidence: `re/findings/can.md`. The slot mechanism is not
awkward; the fallback (hooking the RX dispatcher) is not needed.

How reception actually works: each `tbl_can_rx` slot owns one TouCAN message
buffer filtered on an exact 11-bit id (RXGMSK = 0xFFE00000 on all three
modules). `can_init_mb(slot)` at **0x135750** arms the buffer once at start-up;
a periodic task calls `can_rx_poll(slot)` at **0x4379C8**, which copies the 8
data bytes into `can_rx_shadow` and clears the IFLAG bit. There is no
interrupt and no "new data" flag in the driver: **the return value of
`can_rx_poll` is the new-data flag** — it is the received DLC (8 for our frame)
when a frame arrived since the previous call, and 0x40 when nothing arrived.

Steps to give 0x0EC a slot (target: slot 15, TouCAN **C**, message buffer 6):

1. Patch the id word at **0x2BD8C** from `00 00 07 FF` to `00 00 00 EC`
   (2 bytes change). Leave the rest of the row alone — the DLC byte is never
   read and word 0x2BD88 must stay 0x00000004 so the payload is not
   byte-swapped.
2. `python3 tools/checksum.py fix` — 0x2BD8C sits in the block with descriptor
   0x0A0010 (0x020000-0x02FFFF). Then `verify` must say ALL OK (65 blocks).
3. **No mask register changes.** RXGMSK/RX14MSK/RX15MSK stay as they are;
   0x0EC matches no other buffer on either module.
4. Call `can_init_mb(15)` once from init (`li r3,15; bl 0x135750`), e.g.
   appended to `can_rx_arm_all` at 0x12E570 or from `ff_rx`'s own init.
   Without this the buffer stays CODE = NOT ACTIVE and receives nothing.
5. `ff_rx` calls `can_rx_poll(15)` (`li r3,15; bl 0x4379C8`) every 10-100 ms
   and treats a return value of 8 as "fresh frame".
6. **The 8 data bytes appear at RAM 0x803F9C..0x803FA3** (symbol
   `can_rx_buf_spare0`), in wire order; the id is echoed at 0x803F98.
   The other spares: slot 16 -> 0x803FA8 (id word 0x2BD9C), slot 19 ->
   0x803FCC (0x2BDCC), slot 20 -> 0x803FD8 (0x2BDDC).
7. Timeout handling stays in `ff_rx` per §3.2 — the stock supervision
   (0x429D44 / 0x42A0A0) is per-slot calibrated and has no entry for a new
   slot.
8. No interrupt and no transmit collision: module C's IMASK only covers
   buffers 13-15, and every transmit object lives on module B buffers
   0x0B-0x0D.

**One open bench check before Phase 2 (#22).** All four spare slots are on
TouCAN module **C** (0x707800), while the ECU transmits only on module **B**
(0x707400). Both run at 500 kbit/s with identical timing and C is
receive-only, so the working assumption (HYPOTHESIS) is that B and C hang on
the same Antrieb-CAN pair. Confirm before wiring the Pico node: with the
engine running, check that signals fed by module-C frames (id 0x050 slot 10,
id 0x0C2 slot 9) *and* by module-B frames (id 0x1A0 slot 1) are all live.
If C turns out to be a separate bus, the node must be wired to that bus
instead — module B has no free message buffer.

### 3.2 Validation, filtering, state

```
inputs:  E_raw, T_fuel, status, counter, age (ms since last frame)
state:   E_filt (0..100, 1/16 % resolution), fault_timer, mode

if age > 1000 ms or status in {fault, not ready} or counter unchanged for 3 frames:
    mode = FAULT
elif status == contaminated:
    mode = HOLD                     # keep E_filt, do not follow E_raw
else:
    mode = OK; E_filt += (E_raw - E_filt) * K   (K ≈ 1/32 per 100 ms, ~3 s time constant)
    limit |dE/dt| to 2 %/s          # tank blending cannot be faster
```

Fail-safe rule (asymmetric, as commercial systems do it): on FAULT keep the
last plausible **fuel** factor for 60 s then decay it toward the value stored
at the last key-on (or E0 if none), so a lean-out is impossible during a
transient dropout; but drop the **ignition** and **rail** blends to the
gasoline map immediately, because advance is the dangerous direction.
Power-up: start from the persisted E% (Phase 5); until then from E0.

### 3.3 Fuel factor
Stoichiometry: gasoline 14.7, ethanol 9.0 by mass. For volume fraction `v`
(the sensor reports volume %), with densities 0.745 (gasoline) and 0.789
(ethanol) kg/L, the mass fraction is `w = 0.789 v / (0.789 v + 0.745 (1-v))`,
the blend stoich AFR is `1 / (w/9.0 + (1-w)/14.7)`, and the required fuel
**mass** factor is `F_m = 14.7 / AFR_blend` (1.50 at E85, 1.63 at E100).
Injection **time** in MED9 is derived from fuel mass through the injector
constant (KRKATE in the FR; the 2.0T community still calls it KRKTE) and the
rail-pressure correction, so the factor is applied to the fuel mass, not to
time directly, unless the RE shows the injector constant is volumetric, in
which case divide by the density ratio (1.43 at E85). Field values quoted by
tuners (x1.35-1.50 at E85) span exactly this range, which is why the factor
is a **calibratable 1D curve over E%** (17 points, 1/1024 resolution),
initialised from the formula and trimmed with the wideband.

Insertion point: the multiplication where relative fuel mass `rk` becomes the
injection quantity/time for the bank (exact variable name to be confirmed
from the FR module). The hook multiplies by `F(E_filt)` in fixed point.
`F(0) = 1.000` exactly, so at E0 the patched ECU is bit-identical in behaviour.

Do not use the lambda adaptation (fra/frau/frao) as the correction path: the
35-50 % change exceeds its limits and sets DTCs, it cannot act in open-loop
phases (cranking, warm-up before sensor light-off, WOT enrichment) which is
where E85 goes lean, and it cannot inform ignition.

### 3.4 Ignition
Blend factor `f_zw(E)` from a 1D curve (0 at E0, 1 at about E40-50 where
MBT is usually reached, per prj) applied as
`zw = zw_gas + f_zw * dzw_E(nmot, rl)` where `dzw_E` is a new additive map
in our calibration block (start with +0..+2 deg, up to +6 at knock-limited
high-load cells, calibrated on the dyno/road with knock retard logging).
Do **not** shift `KFZWOP` (torque model optimum) or the knock control
references. Knock retard (`dwkrz`) staying at zero across blends is the
acceptance signal.

### 3.5 Start and warm-up
Ethanol needs roughly twice the cranking fuel around 10 C and barely ignites
below ~10 C without heating. Scale the start quantity and the afterstart /
warm-up enrichment by `f_st(E, tmot)` (2D, small) with generous values at low
`tmot`; this is the hardest part to calibrate (reports agree), so it comes
after the fuel factor is proven warm.

### 3.6 Rail pressure and injection window
E85 lengthens `ti` by 35-50 % at equal rail pressure. Raise the rail
pressure setpoint maps at high load by a blend on E% (within the HPFP's
capability, stock ~11 MPa; tuners run 12.5-13.5 on the 2.0T) and monitor
`ti` against the injection window. If the window is exceeded, limit torque
rather than let the ECU cut the throttle unexpectedly. Log HPFP duty and
setpoint-vs-actual before any WOT on E50+.

### 3.7 Diagnostics
Expose `E_filt`, `T_fuel`, `status/mode`, `F`, `f_zw` in a spare measuring
block (VCDS-readable) or via the DDLI logger, and later as OBD PID 0x52 if the
OBD handler is extended. No DTC is raised by the patch in the MVP; a fault
only switches the mode.

### 3.8 Persistence (Phase 5)
Store `E_filt` in EEPROM via the ECU's own EEPROM block handler or in
battery-backed RAM if the external SRAM is permanently powered (to be
verified), so a cold start after a battery disconnect uses the right cranking
fuel.

## 4. New calibration data

All new parameters live in one block inside 0x5E2510-0x5EFFFF (all 0xFF
today, covered by the 0x5E0000-0x5EFFFF checksum) with a header
(`FFCAL001`, version, length) so the tooling can find it:

| Name | Type | Init |
|---|---|---|
| `ff_can_id` | u16 | 0x0EC |
| `ff_timeout_ms`, `ff_hold_s`, `ff_filter_k`, `ff_slew` | u16 | 1000, 60, 32, 2 |
| `ff_F_curve[17]` | u16 x 1/1024 vs E% 0..100 step 6.25 | formula |
| `ff_fzw_curve[17]` | u8 x 1/256 | 0 .. 1 |
| `ff_dzw_map[8][8]` | s8 x 0.75 deg | 0 |
| `ff_fst_map[6][6]` | u16 x 1/1024 | 1.0 |
| `ff_prail_add[8]` | u8 x 0.1 MPa | 0 |

## 5. RAM

Needs about 64 bytes: frame copy, timestamps, `E_filt`, mode, factors,
counters. Allocation only after the RAM survey (static references +
RequestUpload snapshots across several ignition cycles) proves a range unused.

## 6. Verification plan

| Step | Where | Pass criterion |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests of filter, fail-safe state machine, curve interpolation | emulator | matches a Python model bit for bit |
| Pico status paths | signal generator | correct status/E% for 40, 49, 50, 100, 150, 156, 185 Hz, no signal |
| RX slot proof | bench ECU + logger | frame bytes appear in the identified RAM buffer |
| E0 equivalence | bench then car | logs (lambda, ti, fra, zw) identical to stock within noise over the same drive cycle |
| Blend steps E20, E50, E85 | car, wideband | `fra/frau` within ±5 % of 1.0 after adaptation reset; no lean event at WOT; `dwkrz` unchanged; `ti` inside window; rail follows setpoint |
| Fault injection | car, idle then driving | unplug sensor: fuel factor held, ignition back to gasoline, no misfire; replug: recovers |
| Cold start series | car, over a season | start time and afterstart lambda at 20, 10, 0, -10 C on E85 comparable to gasoline |

## 7. RE targets with acceptance criteria

| Target | Done when |
|---|---|
| Powertrain TouCAN module and the RX slot -> RAM mapping for the table at 0x2BC90 | writing a frame to a free slot's id on the bench makes its bytes appear at a known RAM address |
| Periodic task table / hook point (100 ms) | a counter patch increments at 10 Hz |
| Fuel mass -> injection quantity multiplication (KRKATE path) and its variables (`rk`, `te`/`ti` per bank) | logged `ti` reproduces the decompiled formula for logged inputs |
| Lambda adaptation variables (`fra`, `frau`, `frao`, `rkat`) | found in the measuring-variable table and logged |
| `KFZW/KFZW2` blend and the final `zw` output; `dwkrz` | map addresses confirmed by xref and by a bench edit |
| Start/afterstart maps and `tmot` | same |
| Rail setpoint maps and `ti` window limits | same |
| `vkKraQu` presence (fuel-quality variant byte) | present/absent decided; if present, its consumers listed |
| EEPROM block handler | write path understood (Phase 5) |
| Security access algorithm (KWP 0x27) | logger authenticates |
